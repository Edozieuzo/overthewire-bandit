This repository contains my personal writeups for the [OverTheWire Bandit wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).  
Bandit is designed to teach Linux basics, command-line skills, and a hacker’s problem-solving mindset.  
The goal is to learn Linux, basic security, and command-line skills by solving each level step by step.

# Structure
